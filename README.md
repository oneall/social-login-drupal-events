# Social Login Event Subscriber Example
EventSubscriber example module for OneAll Social Login. 

In this example module, the custom fields `first_name`, `last_name` and `full_name` 
are populated with the data retrieved from the social network profile after a user
has registered using a social network account.

You can modify the `SocialLoginSubscriber.php` file in order to add your custom
data processing.

Depends on our Social Login module for Drupal 8.x:
